72,mikeee453117,5.7,You need your maintenance crew to fix things that are leaking or broke. In room 208 the left sink fixture leaked and the right one had a broken stopper. The toilet seat was loose. Also your staff might want to think about allowing really drunk guest to stay at your facility and ruining a nights stay. They checked in a guest after midnight into 208 and he came in fell down knocking the table down and waking everyone up. He didn't pickup the things he knockoff the table.

1185,Anonymous,8.3,"Really good hostel, the security was great and there is even proper luggage storage if you arrive before check in or if you have to check out but have a later flight. I found it to be a very clean place to stay, it seems like there was always someone cleaning which was nice. Location is pretty close to everything, just within walking distance of main spots. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was good, the free breakfast was a great bonus too.",18-Jun-16,"Canada, ",2016,Jun,0,5,0,0,6,0,2,5,0,10
1186,Anonymous,8.9,"I stayed in 10 beds female dorm room. Each bed has the curtain, plug and light. The location is perfect for me just near the bus station, 3 mins by foot, 10-15minutes walk to o'connor street. Some of the people were chatting really loud during the night time at around 21:30 to 23:30. The quality of sound-proofing of the bedroom door is not good.
 All in all, recommend this hostel.",18-Jun-16,"Taiwan, ",2016,Jun,0,3,0,0,2,0,1,3,0,4
1187,Anonymous,9.7,I really enjoyed my stay at Jacobs Inn. I liked that they had curtains you could pull for a bit of privacy on your bunk and that they had USB ports. The breakfast was good and all the facilities were clean. Overall it was probably the nicest hostel I stayed in during my travels!,16-Jun-16,"USA, ",2016,Jun,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,4
